   Book2Cook is application that allows you to share homemade recipes with friends and family in a social media style.
With Book2Cook you can create and print unique cookbooks have them delivered at your home.  We built this application because we believe in the power of sharing good meals and preserving traditions.


Features:
* Easily create recipes.
* Build and customize your own cookbook.
* Have your cookbook delivered at your home.
* Share Recipes with Family and Friends.


Book2Cook relies heavily on Ruby on Rails. I used the Prawn Gem to generate the pdf books and added the 3D Flipbook Plugin built on jQuery to give the book an animation effect. The Stripe API handles the payments while the LULU API takes care of the printing and shipping of the book.
